# Movie Errands

Movie Errands is a todo list app for movies, providing details about movies from The Movie Database API. This app is built using both UIKit and SwiftUI, and SwiftUI is the future!

This app is a prototype app to test the limit of SwiftUI. The only reason it's not a pure SwiftUI app is because by the time I started this app, there was still no proper alternative for UISearchController, by which I can have the elegant builtin animation.

There is another team who actually implemented a more aggressive app that achieved the same functionality but was built entirely using SwiftUI. [Dimillian/MovieSwiftUI](https://github.com/Dimillian/MovieSwiftUI)
